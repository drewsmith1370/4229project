## This is a cool project

CSCI 4229
Made by Ethan Coleman. Visualize slime mould.

## Description
This was inspired by my research on bacterial motion and communication.
While I did not use my actual research model to create this screensaver, 
I thought that a slime-mould algorithm captures some of the ideas we see in 
that work and I though it would be fun to code up. Food is pulsed in at random locations
and particles sense how much food exists at their location, they then communicate this
to the group and the other particles will swarm the food source. A random number 
generator is used to determine whether a particle will exhibit this behavior, or simply
swarm in a random direction and "explore" for more food.
