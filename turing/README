## This is a cool project

CSCI 4229
Made by Ethan Coleman. Visualize chemical turing instabilites.

## Description
This was inspired by my research on patterning in fish skin. Non-linear chemical
reactions lead to sinusoidal patterning (strips and spots), and microparticles will
move along the gradients of these instabilities. In our case, microparticles represent
pigment molecules. Here I take a two common patterns seen to arise from these instabilities
and alternate between the patterns to make a fun visual showing the research.
