## Fractal Tree CSCI4229 Screensaver Project

CSCI 4229
Made by Drew Smith.
Demonstrates a faster method for drawing fractal trees. By instancing a VAO with various transformations, fuller and faster trees can be drawn, with each branch generated in parallel.
Inspired by Prof. Vlakkie's fractal tree example. Methodology inspired by YouTuber Acerola's fractal transformations video.

## Instructions

Use wasd to move, cursor keys to look around
Use [ and ] to change angle of branch transformation
