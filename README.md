## CSCI 4229 Project - Computer Graphics

Group Project by Drew Smith and Ethan Coleman. A small collection of shader-based screensavers and programs.
Compile individual programs in their respective directories by running make. Needed libraries include GLUT and GLFW.

# List of Programs

- flow: Perlin noise flowfield, made by Drew Smith
- tree: Fractal tree generator, made by Drew Smith

# Instructions

To run each program in a row: run "make" then "make run" in this directory. Makefiles are also configured to cat READMEs before executing.
Make clean in this directory will clean everything. Make commands are also configured for each subdirectory.

# Future TO-DOs

To further improve the project before final release, here are some notable things we want to do:

- Add non-interactive modes of each screensaver. This will give the user something to look at that is somewhat random each time.
- Add Turing Pattern screensaver (Ethan)
- Add Slime Mold screensaver (Ethan)
- Add Water Surface screensaver (Drew)

Super Stretch goal:

- Attempt Particle-Voxel Fluid Simulation

TODOs for individual programs are found in respective READMEs.
