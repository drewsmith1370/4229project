# A note for different systems

If your graphics card does not support work group size of 1024, change the "INVOCATIONS_PER_GROUP" and workgroup size in the compute shader to match.
Additionally, change the number of branches "NUM_DOTS" to change the amount of workgroups that are dispatched to optimize for your own gpu.

# TODO

Before the final submission, I want to implement the following:

- Ability to dynamically change number of branches
- Query for workgroup size for portability
- Uniform for period (changes how many channels will form per loop)
- Longer lines by using more previous points
