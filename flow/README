## A note for different systems

If your graphics card does not support work group size of 1024, change the "INVOCATIONS_PER_GROUP" and workgroup size in the compute shader to match.
Additionally, change the number of branches "NUM_DOTS" to change the amount of workgroups that are dispatched to optimize for your own gpu.
